**EDEN: Ethical Dilemma Evaluation Network:**

EDEN (Ethical Dilemma Evaluation Network) is a Python-based program designed to simulate decision making between multiple AI-powered chatbots, each representing a distinct ethical perspective. By leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 language model, EDEN helps users explore various ethical viewpoints in response to complex moral dilemmas. The ultimate goal of EDEN is to provide a framework for ethical decision-making in AI systems, fostering the development of AI that is sensitive to diverse ethical considerations. All of the chatbots used implement a DAN-style prompt, which effectively opens up their responses beyond the normal restirctions when it comes to moral and ethical decisions. 

**Overview**
EDEN consists of multiple DANs, each of which embodies a specific ethical theory or perspective. These chatbots are trained to interpret and analyze ethical dilemmas and provide their respective viewpoints. After gathering input from all chatbots, a "Master" chatbot takes into account their responses and makes a decision based on the scenario given.

**AI Agents:**
Egoist - EDAN
Hedonist - HDAN
Naturalist - NDAN
Virtue Theorist -VDAN
Existentialist - XDAN
Kantianist - KDAN
Utilitarianist - UDAN
Religious - RDAN
Master - MDAN

**Applications:**
EDEN's framework can be utilized in various scenarios, including:

Educational purposes: EDEN can serve as a learning tool for students and individuals interested in understanding different ethical theories and their applications.

AI ethics research: Researchers in AI ethics can use EDEN to study the strengths and weaknesses of different ethical perspectives and improve AI decision-making models.

Policy-making: EDEN can support decision-makers in understanding the ethical implications of their choices by offering multiple perspectives on complex issues.

Ethics committees: Organizations with ethics committees can use EDEN as a supplementary tool to help them evaluate and understand various ethical considerations in their decision-making processes.

**How EDEN Works:**
The user inputs a difficult ethical dilemma or chooses to generate one using GPT-4.

Each chatbot analyzes the ethical dilemma and responds with its perspective on the issue.

The "Master" chatbot evaluates the responses from all chatbots, considering their ethical perspectives and formulating a well-rounded ethical decision.

The final decision is presented to the user, providing valuable insights into the ethical implications of the dilemma.
